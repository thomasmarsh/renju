# Renju

WIP. This repo is for experimenting with MCTS in Haskell, starting with Gomoku,
and hopefully an eventual Renju implementation.

This work is building directly off of work by [William Kenyon](https://github.com/wkenyon):
* [MCTS Implementation](https://github.com/wkenyon/mcts)
* [Thesis](https://github.com/wkenyon/partii-thesis)
